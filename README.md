## 📌 Project Overview

This project recreates the classic Kyrgyz board game **Toguz Korgool** as an interactive web application.

The game is played by two players (Player A and Player B).  
Each player has 9 pits containing stones called **korgools**, plus a store (kazan) for captured stones.  
On each turn, the player selects one of their pits and distributes its korgools counter-clockwise according to the traditional rules.

The objective is to **capture more than half of all korgools (≥ 82 stones)**.

This prototype was developed as the **Fall-semester implementation** for the Senior Project course (COM-431.1) at the American University of Central Asia.

## 🎮 Gameplay at a Glance

- **Two rows of 9 pits** (top: Player B, bottom: Player A)
- Each pit starts with **9 korgools**
- On your turn, click one of your pits:
  - If the pit has **1 stone**, that stone is sown into the **next** pit.
  - If the pit has **more than 1 stone**, **1 stone remains** in the selected pit, and the rest are sown one-by-one into subsequent pits.
- If the **last stone** lands in an opponent’s pit and that pit now has an **even number of stones**, they are captured into your **kazan**.
- When a player’s kazan reaches **82 or more stones**, the game ends and the winner is declared.
- The implementation also supports the **tuz / sool** rule (special capturing pit) with standard restrictions.
