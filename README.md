## 📌 Project Overview

This project recreates the classic Kyrgyz board game **Toguz Korgool** as an interactive web application.

The game is played by two players (Player A and Player B).  
Each player has 9 pits containing stones called **korgools**, plus a store for captured stones.  
On each turn, the player selects a pit and distributes its korgools across the board following traditional rules.

The objective is simple: **capture more than half of all korgools to win**.

This implementation focuses on:

- Clear and intuitive board visualization  
- Simple gameplay (click pits to make a move)  
- Correct sowing and capturing logic  
- Fully functional on all modern browsers (desktop & mobile)
